# In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character operations (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

# Single-character operations:

#     inserting a new character into a string

#     removing a character from a string

#     replacing a character in a string with another character

# This measure is used in information processing, data processing, machine speech recognition, DNA analysis, plagiarism recognition or spelling correction.


# Example:


#     python
#     python3


# The Levenshtein distance between the above strings is 1, because one simple operation (insert new character) is enough to transform the first string into the second.


# Example:


#     python
#     cython


# The Levenshtein distance between the above strings is 1, because one simple operation (replacing a character in a string with another character) is enough to transform the first string to the second.


# Example:


#     c++
#     c


# Levenshtein's distance between the above strings is 2, because two simple operations (removing two characters from the string) are enough to transform the first string to the second.

# Implement a function called lev() that calculates the Levenshtein distance of two strings. You can use the formula below:

# Where |a| stands for the length of a string, and tail(a) stands for all string characters except the first. For example, tail('python')-> 'ython'. Note that there is a recursion here.


# You just need to implement the lev() function. 


def lev(a, b):
    
    if len(b) == 0:
        return len(a)
    
    if len(a) == 0:
        return len(b)
    
    if a[0] == b[0]:
        return lev(a[1:], b[1:])
    
    residual = 1 + min(lev(a[1:], b), lev(a, b[1:]), lev(a[1:], b[1:]))
    return residual
