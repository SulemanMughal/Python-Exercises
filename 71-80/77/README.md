# Exercise No. 77

The *Matrix* class has been implemented.

Add a read-only property named size to the *Matrix* class that returns the size of the matrix.


#### Example:


    [IN]: m = Matrix([[3, 1, 6], [5, 2, 6]])
    [IN]: m.size
    [OUT]: (2, 3)


#### Example:


    [IN]: m = Matrix([[], []])
    [IN]: m.size
    [OUT]: (0, 0)


You only need to complete the implementation of the *Matrix* class. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
