# The cdr.csv file is attached to the exercise. The file contains the quotations of CD Projekt S. A. company for March 2021:


#     Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
#     2021-03-01,237.4,241,225.2,240.3,1089101
#     2021-03-02,240.9,245.9,236,241.3,674141
#     2021-03-03,241.8,245.3,227,228.3,836642
#     ...


# Explanations:

#     Date - session date

#     Open - share price at the open of the session

#     High - the highest share price during the session

#     Low - the lowest share price during the session

#     Close - share price at the close of the session

#     Volume - trading volume


# The cdr.csv file has been loaded as shown below:


#     import csv
     
     
#     with open('cdr.csv', 'r') as file:
#         reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=',')
#         columns = next(reader)
#         rows = list(reader)
#         data = list(
#             map(
#                 lambda row: (row[0], float(row[2]), float(row[3])),
#                 rows,
#             )
#         )


# We want to determine the height of a single candle (one session) calculated as the distance from the highest to the lowest price. To do this, implement a function called max_min_diff() that returns the calculated distances. Use the data variable for calculations.

# In response, call the max_min_diff() function and print the result to the console.


# Expected result:


#     [IN]: max_min_diff(data)
#     [OUT]: [15.8, 9.9, 18.3, 11.5, 9.0, 5.5, 10.7, 16.5, 17.0, 14.8, 9.1, 9.6, 8.9, 11.0, 9.1, 4.2, 9.6, 7.3, 13.8, 7.4, 27.5, 34.8, 22.2]
