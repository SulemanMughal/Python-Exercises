# Exercise No. 96

The *Stack* class has been implemented.

HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.

In an HTML document, elements are separated by HTML tags. A simple opening HTML tag has the form `<name>` and the corresponding closing tag is `</name>`. For example, the opening `<body>` tag and the matching `</body>` tag. Other commonly used HTML tags:

-   <body>

-   <h1>, <h2>, ...

-   <center>

-   <p>

-   <ol>

-   <li>

    <ul>

Tags usually go in pairs. An opening tag begins a section of page content, and a closing tag ends it. For example, to markup a section of text as a paragraph, you would open the paragraph with an opening paragraph tag `<p>` and close it with a closing paragraph tag `</p>` (closing tags always proceed the element with a `/`).

A few tags are called non-container tags, because they don't contain any content. Examples are images and line breaks, for example `<img>`.

In this exercise, we only consider the tags that need to be closed.


#### HTML file example:


    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is my first page.</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my blog.</p>
    </body>
    </html>


Implement a function called `is_valid_html()` that checks if the HTML document (in the form of a `str` object) is valid for the number of open and closed HTML tags.

The function returns the boolean value *True* if the HTML document is valid, on the contrary *False*. The function takes one argument.

When implementing `is_valid_html()` function, think about how you can solve this problem using the stack. For this purpose, use the *Stack* class.


#### Example:


    html_template = """<html>
    <head>
        <title>Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is my first page.</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my blog.</p>
    </body>
    </html>"""


    [IN]: is_valid_html(html_template)
    [OUT]: True


You just need to implement the `is_valid_html()` function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
