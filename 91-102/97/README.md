# Exercise No. 97

The *Stack* class has been implemented.

A function called `is_valid_html()` has been implemented that checks if the HTML document (in the form of a str object) is valid for the number of open and closed HTML tags.

Load the two files attached to the exercise:

-   template1.html

-   template2.html

And check the correctness of HTML documents using the implemented `is_valid_html()` function. Print the result to the console.


#### Expected result:


    True
    False
