# Exercise No. 99


The *Stack* class has been implemented.

Add a method called `clear()` to the Stack class that clears the stack (remove all items in the stack).


#### Example:


    [IN]: techs = Stack()
    [IN]: techs.push('python')
    [IN]: techs.push('django')
    [IN]: len(techs)
    [OUT]: 2
     
    [IN]: techs.clear()
    [IN]: len(techs)
    [OUT]: 0


You just need to implement the `clear()` method of the Stack class. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
