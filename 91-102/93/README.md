# Exercise No. 93

The *Stack* class has been implemented.

Implement a function called `is_palindrome()` that checks if the text is a palindrome. A palindrome is an expression that sounds the same way read left to right and right to left. For example, the following expressions are a palindrome:

-   `'civic'`

-   'kayak'

-   'level'

-   'pip'

The function returns *True* if the expression is a palindrome, on the contrary, *False*. The function takes one argument.

When implementing `is_palindrome()` function, think about how you can solve this problem using the stack. For this purpose, use the Stack class.

#### Example:


    [IN]: is_palindrome('kajak')
    [OUT]: True
     
    [IN]: is_palindrome('kajaki')
    [OUT]: False


You just need to implement the `is_palindrome()` function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
