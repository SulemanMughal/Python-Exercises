# Exercise No. 11

Consider the **palindromic numbers**. A palindromic or symmetric number is a number that does not change when you write its digits in reverse order.

Some examples of palindromic numbers:
-   363
-   2882
-   29492

A function called `is_palindrome()` is implemented that checks if the number is palindromic in decimal and binary notation.

Implement a function called `calculate()` that returns all three-digit palindromic numbers in both decimal and binary notation. In response, call `calculate()` function and print the result to the console.

#### Expected result:
`[313, 585, 717]`
