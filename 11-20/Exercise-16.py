# Consider the problem below. We have an application in which at some point we get a matrix in the form of a string (an object of the str type). For example, the following string:


#     string = """4 2 7
#     1 5 4
#     2 6 8"""


# represents a 3x3 matrix. Each row of the matrix is stored on a separate line. Each element of a row is separated from another element by a space.

# It's hard to work with these matrices and perform some additional operations. We will transform such a matrix into nested lists:


#     [[4, 2, 7], [1, 5, 4], [2, 6, 8]]


# Implement a class named Matrix that takes the matrix as a string in the __init__() method and sets the value of the instance attribute called matrix as nested lists.


# Examples:


#     [IN]: m = Matrix('3 4\n5 6')
#     [IN]: m.matrix
#     [OUT]: [[3, 4], [5, 6]]
     
#     [IN]: m = Matrix('3 4\n5 6\n7 8')
#     [IN]: m.matrix
#     [OUT]: [[3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]
