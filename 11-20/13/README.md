# Exercise No. 13

Consider a simple number compression algorithm that works as follows:

    111155522500 -> '14_53_22_51_02'

The algorithm goes from left to right through the number and returns an object of type str. Each encountered digit is stored along with the number of times that digit repeats until another digit is encountered in the number. Each such pair is separated by the `'_'` character.

Implement a function called `compress()` that compresses number as described above.

#### Examples:
```
    [IN]: compress(100000)
    [OUT]: '11_05'


    [IN]: compress(9993330)
    [OUT]: '93_33_01'


    [IN]: compress(6540000)
    [OUT]: '61_51_41_04'
```

**Tip** : You can use the itertools built-in module and the groupby class in your solution.

You just need to implement the function. The  tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
