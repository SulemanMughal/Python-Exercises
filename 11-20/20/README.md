# Exercise No. 20

Let's consider vectors consisting of only ones and zeros. Let us also assume an additional convention for representing such a vector. For example, a vector:

    u = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]


we will present as a sequence:

    '01101010'


For the vectors so defined, we can determine the **Hamming distance**. The Hamming distance of vectors u and v is the number of elements where the vectors u and v are different.


#### Example: 

The Hamming distance of the vectors `'1100100'`, `'1010000'` is equal to 3.


Implement a function called `hamming_distance()` that returns the Hamming distance of two vectors. To calculate the Hamming distance, the vectors must be of the same length. If the vectors are of different lengths raise the *ValueError* with the following message:

`'Both vectors must be the same length.'`


#### Example:

```
    [IN]: hamming_distance('01101010', '11011011')
    [OUT]: 4
```


#### Example:

```
    [IN]: hamming_distance('110', '10100')
    [OUT]: ValueError: Both vectors must be the same length.
```

You just need to implement the `hamming_distance()` function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
