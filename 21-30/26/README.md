# Exercise No. 26

A file called *hashtags.txt* containing hashtags related to sport is attached to the exercise:

```
    #sport #fitness #training #motivation #gym #sports #workout #fit #football #love #instagood #fitnessmotivation
    #lifestyle #running #like #bodybuilding #healthy #instagram #health #soccer #follow #crossfit #photography #bhfyp #run
    #nature #fun #healthylifestyle #muscle #bhfyp #fashion #fitfam #gymlife #photooftheday #team #personaltrainer #nike
    #picoftheday #exercise #mma #sportlife #boxing #athlete #bike #basketball #happy #deporte #gymmotivation #strong
    #cycling #yoga #style #ufc #sportmotivation #fitnessgirl #calcio #instafit
```

Implement a function called `clean_hashtags()` that takes three arguments:

-   *input_file* - filename containing hashtags

-   *output_file* - filename to which the hashtags should be saved

-   *length* - the maximum length of the hashtag

The `'#'` sign is not included in the length of the hashtag. For example, the hashtag `'#gym'` has a length of 3.

The `clean_hashtags()` function loads a file called *input_file* and does some hashtag cleanup. The function extracts hashtags up to *length* characters long and also removes duplicates. It then saves the alphabetically sorted hashtags to a file called *output_file*, saving each hashtag in a new line.


#### Example:
`[IN]: clean_hashtags('hashtags.txt', 'clean.txt', 5)`


The contents of the clean.txt file after calling the function:

```
    #bhfyp
    #bike
    #fit
    #fun
    #gym
    #happy
    #like
    #love
    #mma
    #nike
    #run
    #sport
    #style
    #team
    #ufc
    #yoga
```

You just need to implement the `clean_hashtags()` function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
