# Binary number system is a positional numeral system employing 2 as the base and so requiring only two different symbols for its digits, 0 and 1, instead of the usual 10 different symbols needed in the decimal system. The numbers from 0 to 10 are thus in binary 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, and 1010.

# For example, the number 10 in binary can be represented as 1010 because:

# 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10


# A function called decimal_to_binary() that converts a number from decimal to binary has been implemented:


#     def decimal_to_binary(number):
#         if number == 0:
#             return '0'
#         result = ''
#         while number > 0:
#             result += str(number % 2)
#             number = number // 2
#         return result[::-1]


# Now consider a bitwise AND operation on binary numbers. The operation is applied to pairs of natural numbers by performing operations on the digits of the binary notation of these numbers. A bitwise AND takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits, which is equivalent to multiplying them. Thus, if both bits in the compared position are 1, the bit in the resulting binary representation is 1 (1 Ã— 1 = 1); otherwise, the result is 0 (1 Ã— 0 = 0 and 0 Ã— 0 = 0). For example:


#     00001010
#     10001100
#     --------
#     00001000


# The above decimal numbers are 10 and 140. Where the binary number is shorter, we put extra zeros on the left side to perform the operation. The result of this operation is the number 00001000, which is the number 8 in decimal notation. We can write the whole operation as follows:


#     10 & 140 = 8


# Implement a function called bitwise_and() that takes two decimal numbers as arguments and returns the result of the bitwise AND operation in decimal. You can use int() to convert a number from binary to decimal. In case any of the arguments are less than zero raise the ValueError with the message:


#     'Both numbers must be positive.'


# Example:


#     [IN]: bitwise_and(10, 140)
#     [OUT]: 8


# Example:


#     [IN]: bitwise_and(25, 19)
#     [OUT]: 17


# Example:


#     [IN]: bitwise_and(-25, 19)
#     [OUT]: ValueError: Both numbers must be positive.


# You just need to implement the bitwise_and() function.
