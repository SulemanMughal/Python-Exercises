# Exercise No. 6

Consider the **palindromic numbers**. A palindromic or symmetric number is a number that does not change when you write its digits in reverse order.

Some examples of palindromic numbers:
-   363
-   2882
-   29492

Implement a function that returns the largest palindromic number resulting from the product of two-digit numbers.

Present the solution in the form of a function called `calculate()`. In response, call `calculate()` function and print the result to the console.

#### Expected result:
`9009`
