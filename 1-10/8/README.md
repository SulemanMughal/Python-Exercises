# Exercise No. 8

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

Examples of prime numbers: `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...`

Implement a function called `is_prime()` that takes a natural number as an argument and checks if it is a prime number. In the case of a prime number, the function returns *True*, otherwise *False*.

#### Example:
`[IN]: is_prime(11)`

`[OUT]: True`

You just need to implement the function. The  tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
