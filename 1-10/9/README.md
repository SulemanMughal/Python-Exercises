# Exercise No. 9

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

Examples of prime numbers: `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...`

The prime number in position one is 2. The prime number in position two is 3. The prime number in position three is 5. Implement a function that returns a prime number at position 100.

In the solution, use the function `is_prime()` from the previous exercise:

```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n == 2
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        i += 2
    return True
```

Present the solution in the form of a function called `calculate()`. In response, call `calculate()` function and print the result to the console.

#### Expected result:
`541`
