# Exercise No. 62

**Binary number system** is a positional numeral system employing 2 as the base and so requiring only two different symbols for its digits, 0 and 1, instead of the usual 10 different symbols needed in the decimal system. The numbers from 0 to 10 are thus in binary 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, and 1010.

For example, the number 10 in binary can be represented as 1010 because:

1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10


A function called `decimal_to_binary()` that converts a number from decimal to binary has been implemented:

```
def decimal_to_binary(number):
    if number == 0:
        return '0'
    result = ''
    while number > 0:
        result += str(number % 2)
        number = number // 2
    return result[::-1]
```

Now consider an **XOR** operation on binary numbers. The operation is applied to pairs of natural numbers by performing operations on the digits of the binary notation of these numbers. The result contains ones in positions with the same values in both strings, otherwise zeros, for example:

    00001010
    10001100
    --------
    10000110


The above decimal numbers are 10 and 140. Where the binary number is shorter, we put extra zeros on the left side to perform the operation. The result of this operation is the number 10000110, which is the number 134 in decimal notation. We can write the whole operation as follows:

    10 ^ 140 = 134


Implement a function called `bitwise_xor()` that takes two decimal numbers as arguments and returns the result of the bitwise XOR operation in decimal. You can use `int()` to convert a number from binary to decimal. In case any of the arguments are less than zero raise the *ValueError* with the message:

    'Both numbers must be positive.'


#### Example:

    [IN]: bitwise_xor(25, 19)
    [OUT]: 10


#### Example:

    [IN]: bitwise_xor(10, 3)
    [OUT]: 9


#### Example:

    [IN]: bitwise_xor(-10, 3)
    [OUT]: ValueError: Both numbers must be positive.


You just need to implement the `bitwise_xor()` function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
