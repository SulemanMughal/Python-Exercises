The *cdr.csv* file has been loaded. All closing prices have been extracted as a list and assigned to the variable *closes*:


    [240.3, 241.3, 228.3, 235.0, 232.0, 232.0, 223.0, 210.2, 221.0, 226.5, 229.9, 229.5, 231.0, 220.7, 223.2, 217.0, 220.7, 217.1, 208.1, 212.0, 239.7, 217.9, 190.5]


We want to calculate the n-period moving average for the price. To do this, implement a function called `moving_avg()` that takes two arguments:

-   *prices* - list of prices for the calculation of the moving average
-   *window_size* - the number of periods for which we calculate the moving average (for example window_size = 15 is a 15-day moving average)

and returns a list with the values for the moving average (each average value rounded to two decimal places).

Please note that a moving average list (result) is n - 1 items shorter than a list with prices.


#### Example:


    [IN]: moving_avg(closes, 8)
    [OUT]: [230.26, 227.85, 226.0, 226.2, 225.51, 225.39, 223.98, 224.0, 224.85, 224.81, 223.64, 220.91, 218.72, 219.81, 219.46, 215.38]
