# Load the cdr.csv file. You can use the built-in csv module for this. Extract all closing prices as a list and assign to the variable closes:


#     [240.3, 241.3, 228.3, 235.0, 232.0, 232.0, 223.0, 210.2, 221.0, 226.5, 229.9, 229.5, 231.0, 220.7, 223.2, 217.0, 220.7, 217.1, 208.1, 212.0, 239.7, 217.9, 190.5]


# We want to calculate the 3-day moving average for the close price. Try to implement a function called moving_avg(), which takes a list of closing prices as an argument and returns a list with values for a 3-day moving average (round the values to two decimal places). Please note that the number of items in the 3-day moving average list is less than the number with closing prices by 2 items.


# In response, call moving_avg() function and print the result to the console.


# Expected result:


#     [236.63, 234.87, 231.77, 233.0, 229.0, 221.73, 218.07, 219.23, 225.8, 228.63, 230.13, 227.07, 224.97, 220.3, 220.3, 218.27, 215.3, 212.4, 219.93, 223.2, 216.03]
